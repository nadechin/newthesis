I was able to make high processing system, and a moving apparatus is wide, and the OS's such as the Linux system came to be in this way used for people on a device, and, meanwhile, one's apparatus is stepped over by an unjust invasion of SSH, and I am attacked to the network apparatus of the third party from an apparatus of oneself by the spread of PCs and the system advancement of the IoT device, and a problem made in the environment that a virus and a back door are installed, and is carried out a virus an apparatus of oneself illegally occurs.
Let an intruder detect it by making the environment that there is ,Honeypot as a window what kind of ways an intruder behaves when was invaded, and is easy to invade it daringly in SSH when succeeded in a login trial, and Honeypot which collect the log of the command that carried out on this occasion, and emulated behavior of Shell now again is wide, and is used, and there are few commands that this Honeypot can carry out; as a result of being implemented, and therefore being detected by an intruder to Honeypot when invasion ahead was Honeypot, and expanding the command of Honeypot by the there prior experiment, and having compared the log that collected invasion log in Honeypot which expanded Honeypot and the command that did not expand, and collected by using a probabilistic calculation method, with Honeypot which expanded Honeypot and the command that did not expand, collected invasion log more in Honeypot using the real OS, and invasion log of Honeypot which showed that could acquire a pattern of the command practice log of more intruders, and expanded the command in this study used semantic analysis of the natural language processing for the real OS in the invasion log of these three how to show approximation to invasion log when was invaded of unjust SSH, and evaluated a semantically thing nearby in invasion log than the invasion log that collected in Honeypot which the invasion log that collected in Honeypot which expanded because a vector expressed one one meaning of the command did not expand in Honeypot using the real OS.
