I was able to make high processing system, and a moving apparatus is wide, and the OS's such as the Linux system came to be in this way used for people on a device, and, meanwhile, one's apparatus is stepped over by an unjust invasion of SSH, and I am attacked to the network apparatus of the third party from an apparatus of oneself by the spread of PCs and the system advancement of the IoT device, and a problem made in the environment that a virus and a back door are installed, and is carried out a virus an apparatus of oneself illegally occurs.
Let an intruder detect it by making the environment that there is ,Honeypot as a window what kind of ways an intruder behaves when was invaded, and is easy to invade it daringly in SSH when succeeded in a login trial, and Honeypot which collect the log of the command that carried out on this occasion, and emulated behavior of Shell now again is wide, and is used, and there are few commands that this Honeypot can carry out; showed that could acquire a pattern of the command practice log of more intruders by being implemented, and therefore being detected by an intruder to Honeypot when invasion ahead was Honeypot, and expanding the command of Honeypot by a there prior experiment, and evaluated it using natural language processing whether invasion log of Honeypot which expanded the command in this study was similar to invasion log when was invaded of SSH which was how unjust for the real OS.
